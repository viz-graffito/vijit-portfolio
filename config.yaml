  # About

  descripe_l1_person: "Hii there! Myself **Rohan** and I am persuing my B.Tech in **DataScience** at **Jain University** having CGPA of **8.88**. I am very passionate about evergrowing technology especially in the field of DataScience and Web Devolopment."
  descripe_l2_person: "### Real world capabilities"
  descripe_l3_person: "I believe Skills are the ability to perform certain tasks well. Some skills can be measured and you acquire them through deliberate effort, others are related to your personality traits. In other words, not all skills are created equal. That’s why we call some of them “hard” and others “soft”.**Hard skills** are the skills that I’ve acquired through deliberate effort. They can be learned, taught, and measured.My hard skills include: **HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, JavaScript, MachineLearning, C and others.**
  **Soft skills**, on the other hand, are closely tied to one’s personality traits. Some of my softskills are **leadership, communication, or other interpersonal skills**. As opposed to hard skills, soft skills cannot be easily taught. Examples of soft skills include: problem-solving, negotiating, multitasking, time management, presenting, and others."
